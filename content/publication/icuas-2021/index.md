abstract: This paper presents a vision-aided state estimator for UAV positioning. The approach combines visual odometry with inertial measurements to provide robust and accurate position estimates, particularly useful in GNSS-denied environments.

summary: A robust state estimation framework for UAV positioning that fuses visual and inertial information for accurate navigation in challenging environments.
