abstract: This paper presents a gyroscope-aided video stabilization method using nonlinear regression on the special orthogonal group SO(3). The approach leverages manifold optimization techniques to achieve smooth and stable video output from UAV platforms.

summary: A novel video stabilization framework that combines gyroscope data with manifold optimization on SO(3) for improved UAV video quality.
