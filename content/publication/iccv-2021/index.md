abstract: This paper presents methods for absolute and relative pose estimation in refractive multi-view scenarios. We derive theoretical frameworks and provide practical implementations for handling refraction in structure from motion pipelines, with applications to underwater imaging and multi-layer refractive scenarios.

summary: Novel approaches for camera pose estimation through refractive interfaces, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction in challenging refractive environments.
