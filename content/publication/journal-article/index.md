abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to refractive pose refinement, generalising the geometric relation between camera and refractive interface. We derive theories for absolute and relative pose estimation under refraction and provide comprehensive implementation details for refractive structure from motion.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A comprehensive framework for pose estimation and 3D reconstruction under refractive conditions, with applications to underwater and multi-layer imaging scenarios.

This work establishes theoretical foundations for pose estimation and 3D reconstruction in refractive environments, addressing the challenging problem of imaging through multiple media with different refractive indices.
