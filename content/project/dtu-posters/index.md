## Overview

During my PostDoc research at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) from February 2021 to June 2021, I created several academic research posters showcasing my work in computer vision, UAV positioning, and advanced image analysis. These posters were developed using customized Beamer poster templates with DTU branding.

## Research Areas

### UAV Positioning and Navigation

The UAV-QMS project focused on developing cost-efficient and long-range Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for high-quality magnetic surveying. Key research topics included:

- **Pose Estimation**: Developing accurate benchmark and pose evaluation systems for UAV positioning
- **Navigation**: Trajectory generation using semidefinite programming for multi-rotors
- **Calibration & Synchronization**: Camera-IMU extrinsic calibration using novel correspondence-free approaches
- **Machine Learning & Fairness**: Investigating unbiased pose estimation networks and fairness in ML-based positioning

### Advanced Image Analysis

Research in advanced image analysis covered:

- **Optical Flow Estimation**: Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck methods for motion estimation
- **Stereo Vision**: Dense stereo matching algorithms for 3D reconstruction
- **Performance Analysis**: Runtime optimization and accuracy benchmarking across multiple datasets
